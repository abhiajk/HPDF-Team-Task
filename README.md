Team 49 google geocoding app
This is a geocoding app that was developed as part Hasura Product Developement Fellowship(HPDF) by Team 49.
The link to the .apk file is: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HdCJ3Cb03JdrhrUwSRBpB19-12C3rS0t/view?usp=sharing
The app has two buttons and two rows to enter Source/starting point and destination. You can either enter the name of the source and destination or can enter the coordinates separated by comma. (eg: source-Delhi & destination-chennai || source-28,77 & destination-27,76). onPress the GetDirections button map-markers are set in source(green marker) and destination(red marker) and a direction polyline is plotted between the two.
The second button works the following way -
To get location name for a set of coordinate: Enter latitude in first row and longitude in second row. onPress the get-distance button an alert box will pop up with location name.
To get coordinates for a location name: Enter location name in anyone of two rows and press the button. An alert box pops up with coordinates.
